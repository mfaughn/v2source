== ROL - Role Segment

*Attention: This segment is r__etained for backwards compatibility as of v 2.7. The reader is referred to the PRT segment described in Chapter 7.__*

The role segment contains the data necessary to add, update, correct, and delete from the record persons involved, as well as their functional involvement with the activity being transmitted.

In general, the ROL segment is used to describe a person playing a particular role within the context of the message. In PM, for example, in the Grant Certificate/Permission message (B07), the ROL segment is used to describe the roles a person may perform pertinent to the certificate in the message.

The positional location of the ROL segment in ADT and Finance messages indicates the relationship. When the segment is used following the IN3 segment, and the role-ROL value is PP or FHCP, the PP or FHCP is related to the health plan. When the segment is used following the PID segment, and the role-ROL value is PP or FHCP, the PP or FHCP is related to the person. When the segment is used following the PV2 segment, and the role-ROL value is PCP or FHCP, the PP or FHCP is related to the patient visit.
