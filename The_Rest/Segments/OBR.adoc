General (taken from ASTM E1238)

The Observation Request (OBR) segment is used to transmit information specific to an order for a diagnostic study or observation, physical exam, or assessment.

The Observation Request segment defines the attributes of a particular request for diagnostic services (e.g., laboratory, EKG) or clinical observations (e.g., vital signs or physical exam). When a placer requests a given set of observations, always include an order segment. For lab tests, the information in the order segment usually applies to a single specimen. However, there is not a one-to-one relationship between specimen and tests ordered. Different test batteries will usually require their own order segments even when they can be performed on a single specimen. In this case, the specimen information must be duplicated in each of the order segments that employ that specimen. For other diagnostic studies, e.g., chest X-ray, a separate order segment will usually be generated for each diagnostic study.

Though multiple observation batteries can be ordered on a single order segment, the observation filler shall generate a separate order segment for each battery that it processes independently, e.g., electrolyte, CBC, vital signs. When reporting the observations, the filling service shall copy the appropriate order (specimen) information from the original order segment into each of the new order segments so that a separate "order" segment is returned to the placer as a "header" for each separate battery of observations.

In the event that an ordered battery of observations cannot be performed, e.g., because of hemolysis on a blood sample, an order segment will be returned to the placer with OBR-25-result status equal to X (to indicate that the study was not performed). In this case, no observation segments will be transmitted.

When observations are successfully completed, the message returned to the placer will include the order segment (OBR) followed by observation (OBX) segments for each distinct observation generated by the order (see Chapter 7). The number of such observation segments will depend upon the number of individual measurements performed in the process.

OBX segments can be sent by the placer along with an order to provide the filling service with clinical data needed to interpret the results. (See Chapter 7 for OBX details.)
