:v291_section: 3.4.7

The IAM segment contains person/patient adverse reaction information of various types. Most of this information will be derived from user-defined tables. Each IAM segment describes a single person/patient adverse reaction. This segment is used in lieu of the _AL1 - Patient Allergy Information Segment_ to support action code/unique identifier mode update definition of repeating segments as defined in 2.10.4.2 in chapter 2, section 2.4.10, "Protocol for interpreting repeating segments or segment groups in an update Message." The AL1 segment is used to support Snapshot mode update definition as defined in 2.10.4.1.
