The Technical Steward for the OM4 segment is Orders and Observations.

This segment applies to observations/batteries that require a specimen for their performance. When an observation or battery requires multiple specimens for their performance (e.g., creatinine clearance requires a 24-hour urine specimen and a serum specimen), multiple segments may be included, one for each specimen type.

OM4 is a repeating segment. It allows multiple specimens per Order Code and accommodates for multiple alternate specimen for each preferred specimen. In some cases an Order Code can require multiple specimens. In many cases there are preferred specimens and for each preferred it is possible to have one or more alternative specimens. The alternative specimen will carry in OM4-17 the Sequence Number â€“ Test/Observation Master File (OM4-1) of the preferred specimen.

If multiple kinds of specimen are associated with this observation (as in the case for a creatinine clearance), multiple segments may be included, one for each specimen type.

This segment will also allow for reporting Preferred and Alternate specimens, when applicable.
