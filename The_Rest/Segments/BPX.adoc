In the processing of blood products, it is necessary for the transfusion service and the placer system to communicate information. The status messages need to contain additional information regarding the blood products requested, such as the unique donation ID, product code, blood type, expiration date/time of the blood product, and current status of the product. This segment is similar to an OBX segment, but contains additional attributes.
