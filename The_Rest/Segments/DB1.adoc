The disability segment contains information related to the disability of a person. This segment was created instead of adding disability attributes to each segment that contains a person (to which disability may apply). This is an optional segment that can be used to send disability information about a person already defined by the Patient Administration Chapter. The disabled person code and identifier allow for the association of the disability information to the person.
