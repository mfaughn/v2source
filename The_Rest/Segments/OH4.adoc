= OH4
:render_as: Level3
:v291_section: 3.4.18

The OH4 segment contains the date range an individual has worked in what is considered a combat or hazardous duty zone; both civilian and military.

The intent is for the segment to be allowed to repeat within a message definition to enable a combat zone history for the patient.

Examples:

A person/ may have worked in a combat zone for 2 years, followed by 3 years where there was no combat zone work, returning to combat zone work for another 2 years. This would be reflected as two Combat work segments documenting the date ranges for the 2 periods when the combat zone work occurred.
