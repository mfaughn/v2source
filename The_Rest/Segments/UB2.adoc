The UB2 segment contains data necessary to complete UB92 bills specific to the United States. Realms outside the US are referred to chapter 16. [.underline]#Only Uniform Billing fields that do not exist in other HL7 defined segments appear in this segment.# For example, Patient Name and Date of Birth are required; they are included in the PID segment and therefore do not appear here. Uniform Billing field locators are provided in parentheses ( ). The UB codes listed as examples are not an exhaustive or current list; refer to a UB specification for additional information.
