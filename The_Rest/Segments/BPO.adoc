Blood product order messages require additional information that is not available in other standard HL7 order messages. Blood product order messages need to contain accompanying details regarding the blood product component, such as special processing requirements (e.g., irradiation and leukoreduction) and the amount of the blood product to be administered.

The following table presents various use cases surrounding blood product orders.
