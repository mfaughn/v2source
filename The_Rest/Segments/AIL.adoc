:v291_section: 10.6.6

The AIL segment contains information about location resources (meeting rooms, operating rooms, examination rooms, or other locations) that can be scheduled. Resources included in a transaction using this segment are assumed to be controlled by a schedule on a schedule filler application. Resources not controlled by a schedule are not identified on a schedule request using this segment. Location resources are identified with this specific segment because of the specific encoding of locations used by the HL7 specification.
