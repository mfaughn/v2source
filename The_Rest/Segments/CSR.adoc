The CSR segment will contain fundamental administrative and regulatory information required to document a patient's enrollment on a clinical trial. This segment is all that is required if one needs to message another system that an enrollment has taken place, i.e., from clinical trials to pharmacy, accounting, or order entry systems. The CSR segment may also be used to identify that OBR, OBX, RXA, and RXR segments that follow represent data applicable to the identified study.
