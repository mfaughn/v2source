This is the "master" pharmacy/treatment order segment. It contains order data not specific to components or additives. Unlike the OBR, it does not contain status fields or other data that are results-only.

It can be used for any type of pharmacy order, including inpatient (unit dose and compound unit dose), outpatient, IVs, and hyperalimentation IVs (nutritional IVs), as well as other non-pharmacy treatments, e.g., respiratory therapy, oxygen, and many nursing treatments.

In addition to the pharmaceutical/treatment information, this segment contains additional data such as provider and text comments.

A quantity/timing field is not needed in the RXO segment. The ORC segment contains the requested _ORC-7-quantity/timing_ of the original order which does not change as the order is encoded, dispensed, or administered.
