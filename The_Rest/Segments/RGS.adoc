The RGS segment is used to identify relationships between resources identified for a scheduled event. This segment can be used, on a site specified basis, to identify groups of resources that are used together within a scheduled event, or to describe some other relationship between resources. To specify related groups of resources within a message, begin each group with an RGS segment, and then follow that RGS with one or more of the Appointment Information segments (AIG, AIL, AIS, or AIP).

If a message does not require any grouping of resources, then specify a single RGS in the message, and follow it with all of the Appointment Information segments for the scheduled event. (At least one RGS segment is required in each message – even if no grouping of resources is required – to allow parsers to properly understand the message.)
