*Definition:* The entity identifier defines a given entity within a specified series of identifiers.

The EI is appropriate for, but not limited to, machine or software generated identifiers. The generated identifier goes in the first component. The remaining components, 2 through 4, are known as the assigning authority; they identify the machine/system responsible for generating the identifier in component 1.

The specified series, the assigning authority, is defined by components 2 through 4. The assigning authority is of the hierarchic designator (HD) data type, but it is defined as three separate components in the EI data type, rather than as a single component as would normally be the case. This is in order to maintain backward compatibility with the EI’s use as a component in several existing data fields. Otherwise, the components 2 through 4 are as defined in Section _2A.2.33_, "_HD - hierarchic designator_". Hierarchic designators (HD) are unique across a given HL7 implementation.

=== Entity Identifier (ST)

=== Namespace ID (IS)

Definition: See Section _2A.2.33.1_, "_Namespace ID (IS)_" for definition. The component intentionally remains associated with the IS data type in v 2.7.

The assigning authority is a unique identifier of the system (or organization or agency or department) that creates the data. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70363[_User-defined Table 0__363 – Assigning Authority_] for suggested values.

*Note:* When the HD is used as a part of another data type, in this case as part of the EI data type, this table may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

By site agreement, implementers may continue to use file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[User-defined Table 0300 – Namespace ID] for the first component
