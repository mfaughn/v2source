Definition: Describes a reference range and its supporting detail.

*Note:* Replaces the CM data type used in sections 8.8.4.6 - OM2-6, 8.8.4.7 - OM2-7 and 8.8.4.8 - OM2-8 as of v 2.5.

Examples:

{empty}a) A range that applies unconditionally, such as albumin, is transmitted as:

|3.0&5.5|

{empty}b) A normal range that depends on sex, such as Hgb, is transmitted as:

|13.5&18^M~12.0 & 16^F|

{empty}c) A normal range that depends on age, sex, and race (a concocted example) is:

|10&13^M^0&2^^^B11&13.5^M^2&20^^^B~12&14.5^M^20&70^^^B~13&16.0^M^70&^^^B|

When no value is specified for a particular component, the range given applies to all categories of that component. For example, when nothing is specified for race/species, the range should be taken as the human range without regard to race. If no age range is specified, the normal range given is assumed to apply to all ages.
