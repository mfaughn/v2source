*Note:* Replaces PN data type as of v 2.3.

*Internationalization Note:* In countries using ideographic or syllabic (phonetic) character sets, it is sometimes necessary to send the name in one or both of these formats, as well as an alphabetic format. The switching between the different character sets can be accomplished using a character set such as JIS X 0202 - ISO 2022 which provides an escape sequence for switching among different character sets and among single-byte and multi-byte character representations. When the name field is repeated, the different repetitions of the name may be represented by these different character sets. The details are as follows. (See also Section 2.9.2, “Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets for PN, XPN, XCN, XON, XAD, FT, ST and TX data types.”)

HL7 supports the following standards for Japanese characters:

JIS X 0201 for ISO-IR 13 (Japanese Katakana)

JIS X 0201 for ISO-IR 14 (Japanese Romaji)

JIS X 0208 for ISO-IR 87 (Japanese Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana)

JIS X 0212 for ISO-IR 159 (supplementary Japanese Kanji)

HL7 supports the following standards for European characters:

ISO 8859 (1-9) for ISO-IR 100, 101, 109, 110, 144,127, 126, 138 and 148.

Character sets are referenced in HL7 as ASCII, 8859/1,8859/2, ISO IR14, ISO IR87, and ISO IR159. DICOM uses codes laid out in ISO 2375, of the form 'ISO-IR xxx'. HL7 supports this naming as well, to facilitate interoperability.

HL7 uses the Basic G0 Set of the International Reference Version of ISO 646:1990 (ISO IR-6) as the default character repertoire for character strings. This is a single-byte character set, identical to ASCII.

Each repetition of a XPN, XON, XCN, or XAD field is assumed to begin with the default character set. If another character set is to be used, the HL7 defined escape sequence used to announce that character set must be at the beginning of the repetition, and the HL7 defined escape sequence used to start the default character set must be at the end of the repetition. Note also that several character sets may be intermixed within a single repetition as long as the repetition ends with a return to the default character set.

An application must specify which character sets it supports in the field _MSH-18 Character Sets_ and which character set handling scheme it supports in the field _MSH-20 Alternate Character Set Handling Scheme_. It is assumed that the sending and receiving applications are aware of how to map character set names (i.e., ISO-IR xxx) to escape sequences.

For example, in many Japanese messages there is a mix of Romaji (i.e., Roman characters), Katakana (phonetic representation of foreign words), Hiragana (phonetic representation of Japanese words) and Kanji (pictographs). Such a message would require 4 character sets be specified in the MSH.

Example 10: Herr Dr. Otto Graf Lambsdorff mdB a.D.

According to German law “Adelstitel” like “Graf” or “Baron” belongs to the family name and therefore must be encoded in the family name field separated by blanks.

=== Family Name (FN) 

Definition: This component allows full specification of the surname of a person. Where appropriate, it differentiates the person's own surname from that of the person's partner or spouse, in cases where the person's name may contain elements from either name. It also permits messages to distinguish the surname prefix (such as "van" or "de") from the surname root. See section _2A.2.30_, "_FN - family name_".

_XPN.1_ will be empty when _XPN.7_ is MSK. It MAY be empty when _XPN.7_ is NAV.

*Usage Note:* If a person’s name has only one component, that name will be sent in _XPN.1 Family Name_. This is common practice in some countries such as Indonesia. This note does not cover the case where only one part of a person's multi-part name is known (e.g., only know "John" of "John Doe").

=== Name Validity Range 

=== Name Assembly Order (ID)

=== Effective Date (DTM)

=== Expiration Date (DTM)

=== Professional Suffix (ST)

=== Called By (ST)

Definition: A "called by" name is the name that is preferred when a person is directly addressed; sometimes known as a nickname.

*Note:* The called by component contains a name that could be categorized as a nickname using the name usage types in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70200[_HL7 Table 0200 - Name type_]. Its use is reserved for instances in which the nickname is a single name part that is provided in addition to a name that has some other type, such as legal. It is understood that the "called by" name is not part of the full name. Where a nickname has more parts, possibly including a family name, a different XPN with a type of nickname should instead be used.

Examples:

____

• James Robert Smith is Called By Jim Bob

• James Robert Smith is Called By JR

• Peter Richard Smith is Called By Richard

• Mary Margaret Elizabeth Jones is Called By Meg.

____

=== Given Name (ST)

=== Second and Further Given Names or Initials Thereof (ST)

=== Suffix (ST)

=== Prefix (ST)

=== Degree

=== Name Type Code (ID) 

Definition: A code that represents the type of name. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70200[_HL7 Table 0200 - Name Type_] for valid values.

*Note:* The content of Legal Name is country specific. In the US the legal name is the same as the current married name.

=== Name Representation Code (ID)

Definition: Different <name/address types> and representations of the same <name/address> should be described by repeating of this field, with different values of the <name/address type> and/or <name/address representation> component.

*Note:* This new component remains in "alphabetic" representation with each repetition of the field using these data types, i.e., even though the name may be represented in an ideographic character set, this component will remain represented in an alphabetic character set.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70465[_HL7 Table 0465 – Name/ad__dress Representation_] for valid values.

In general this component provides an indication of the representation provided by the data item. It does not necessarily specify the character sets used. Thus, even though the representation might provide an indication of what to expect, the sender is still free to encode the contents using whatever character set is desired. This component provides only hints for the receiver, so it can make choices regarding what it has been sent and what it is capable of displaying.
