|===

Definition: Specifies those parameters by which the response will be sorted and by what method.

Example: In a tabular response query, where the return data is known by column name, the SRT might look like:

|LastName^A~FirstName^A|

Example: In a segment response query, where the return data is known by segment and offset, the SRT field would use segment field name notation:

|PID.3.1^A~PID.3.2^A|

=== Sort-by Field (ST)

Definition: Identifies the field by which the response will be sorted. In a tabular response, this will be the column name to sort by. In the Segment Pattern and the Display Response, this will be the segment field name to sort by. See QIP in Section _2A.2.60.1_, "_Segment Field Name (ST)_" for segment field name definition.

See Chapter 5, "Query", for a complete discussion of queries and their responses.
