= Message - A22 Patient Returns From a Leave of Absence
:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 3.3.22

An A22 event is sent to notify systems that an admitted patient has returned to the healthcare institution after a temporary "leave of absence." It is used for systems in which a bed is still assigned to the patient, and it takes their current admitted patient activities off of "hold" status. For example, it is used to notify dietary services and laboratory systems when the patient returns from a weekend trip to his/her home.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

As there is no specific field for the LOA start date/time, it is recommended that field _EVN-6 - Event Occurred_ contain the date/time the patient actually returned from LOA. _PV2-47 - Expected LOA Return Date/Time_ is used to communicate the date/time the patient was expected to return from LOA.
