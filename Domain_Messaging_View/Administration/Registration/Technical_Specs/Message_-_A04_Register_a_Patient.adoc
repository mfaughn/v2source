= Message - A04 Register a Patient
:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 3.3.4

An A04 event signals that the patient has arrived or checked in as a one-time, or recurring outpatient, and is not assigned to a bed. One example might be its use to signal the beginning of a visit to the Emergency Room (= Casualty, etc.).

*Note:* Some systems refer to these events as outpatient registrations or emergency admissions. _PV1-44 - Admit Date/Time_ is used for the visit start date/time.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT - Participation Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRTsegment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the _–PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _–PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT segment, with the applicable _PRT-4 – role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.
