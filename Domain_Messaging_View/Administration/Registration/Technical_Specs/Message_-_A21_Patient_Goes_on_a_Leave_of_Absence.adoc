= Message - A21 Patient Goes on a Leave of Absence 
:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 3.3.21

An A21 event is sent to notify systems that an admitted patient has left the healthcare institution temporarily. It is used for systems in which a bed is still assigned to the patient, and it puts the current admitted patient activities on hold. For example, it is used to notify dietary services and laboratory systems when the patient goes home for the weekend.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

As there is no specific field for the LOA start date/time, it is recommended field _EVN-6 - Event Occurred_ contain the date/time the patient actually left. _PV2-47 - Expected LOA Return Date/Time_ is used to communicate the date/time the patient is expected to return from LOA.
