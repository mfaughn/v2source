= Message - S08 Request Modification of Service/Resource on Appointment 
:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 10.3;10.3.8

Placer request and filler response transactions are the messages and trigger events used between placer applications and filler applications. The placer application initiates transactions using the *SRM* message, requesting that the filler application modify its schedule(s) with the given trigger event and information. The filler application responds to these requests, using the *SRR* message, to either grant or deny the requests from the placer application.

When initiating a request, the placer application will generate and send an *SRM* message containing all of the information necessary to communicate the desired action to the filler application. All required segments and fields (both explicitly required and conditionally required) should be provided to the filler application, as defined in this chapter. When the filler application receives the transaction, it acknowledges it with the appropriate accept acknowledgment using an *ACK* message (assuming that the enhanced acknowledgment mode is in use). After processing the request at the application level, the filler acknowledges the transaction with the appropriate application acknowledgment in an *SRR* message (again assuming that an application acknowledgment was requested under the enhanced acknowledgment mode, or that the original acknowledgment mode is in use). Applying the explanations of the various application acknowledgment codes in the context of this chapter, an application accept from the filler means that the request was processed and accepted by the filler. An application error from the filler means that the request was processed and denied. An application reject from the filler means that the request was not, and could not, be processed due to one or more reasons unrelated to its content (for example: it fails the basic application protocol validation, the filler system is down, or there was an internal error). When appropriate, an *SRR* message with an application accept acknowledgment will contain further information on the request that was processed.

There are no unsolicited messages initiated from a filler application defined in this set of trigger events. Those messages and trigger events are defined below, in Section _10.4_, "_FILLER APPLICATION MESSAGES AND TRIGGER EVENTS UNSOLICITED_."

All of the trigger events associated with placer request and filler response transactions use a common message definition that follows:

Note that in the abstract message definitions for both the SRM and SRR, the patient information segments (segments PID through DG1) are both optional as a group, and repeating as a group. The optionality allows for transactions that relate to a patient, and for those that do not. The ability to repeat the patient information allows for those transactions in which one activity must be scheduled for multiple patients (e.g., for family or group therapy).

In contrast, a transaction may specify no more than (and no less than) one activity. Note that neither the ARQ segment (in the SRM message) nor the SCH segment (in the SRR message) are allowed to repeat, and that they are required. Neither the optionality nor the ability to repeat patient information allows a transaction to specify more than one activity.

The trigger events that use this message definition are listed below.

The request modification of service/resource is triggered on the placer application to request that information pertaining to an existing service or resource be changed for an existing appointment. Services and resources are represented by the AIS, AIG, AIL, and AIP segments on an HL7 scheduling interface transaction. This trigger event should only be used for appointments that have not been completed, or for parent appointments whose children have not been completed. If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned, optionally containing an SCH segment and related detail segments describing the modified appointment.

This trigger event should not be used when an existing resource or service must be replaced or rescheduled for an existing appointment. The following fields on the indicated segments should not be changed by this trigger event: the first three fields of the AIS, the first four fields of the AIG, the first four fields of the AIL, and the first four fields of the AIP. Instead, use two trigger events to accomplish the replacement or rescheduling of a service or resource: S09 (request cancellation of service/resource on appointment), as well as S07 (request addition of service/resource on appointment).
