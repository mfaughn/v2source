= Message - S13 Notification of Appointment Rescheduling
:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 10.4;10.4.2

Unsolicited transactions from filler applications are the messages and trigger events used between filler applications and auxiliary applications. Transactions are initiated by the filler application, using the *SIU* message to notify auxiliary applications of modifications in a filler application's schedule(s). The auxiliary application responds to these notifications, using the *ACK* message, either to acknowledge receipt of the transaction, or to signal that an interfacing error of some kind has occurred.

This set of trigger events is also used to notify applications fulfilling the placer application role of changes in the filler application's schedule(s), if the application is configured to accept these messages and trigger events as an auxiliary application would. As the discussion of application roles has indicated above, any one application can have more than one application role. If it is important that the application acting in the placer application role in your messaging environment be notified of unsolicited changes to a filler application's schedule(s), then it must also support the role of an auxiliary application.

When initiating a notification transaction, the filler application will generate and send an *SIU* message containing all of the information necessary to communicate the desired information to the auxiliary application. All required segments and fields (both explicitly required and conditionally required) should be provided by the filler application, as defined in this chapter. When the auxiliary application receives the transaction, it acknowledges with the appropriate accept acknowledgment using an *ACK* message (assuming that the enhanced acknowledgment mode is in use). After processing the notification at the application level, the auxiliary application acknowledges the transaction with the appropriate application acknowledgment in an *ACK* message (assuming that an application acknowledgment was requested under the enhanced acknowledgment mode, or that the original acknowledgment mode is in use). Applying the explanations of the various application acknowledgment codes (detailed in Chapter 2) in the context of this chapter, an application accept from the auxiliary application means that the notification was processed and accepted. An application error from the auxiliary application means that the auxiliary application was unable to process the notification at the application level. An application reject from the auxiliary application means that the request was not, and could not, be processed due to one or more reasons unrelated to its content (for example: it fails the basic application protocol validation, the system is down, or there was an internal error).

All of the trigger events associated with unsolicited transactions from filler applications use a common message definition that follows:

This message is sent from a filler application to notify other applications that an existing appointment has been rescheduled. The information in the SCH segment and the other detail segments as appropriate describe the new date(s) and time(s) to which the previously booked appointment has been moved. Additionally, it describes the unchanged information in the previously booked appointment.

This transaction should not be used to reschedule an appointment that has begun but has not been completed. In such cases, and only if it logical to do so, the appointment should be discontinued and a new schedule request should be submitted. Likewise, this transaction should not be used to reschedule a parent appointment, in which one or more children have begun or have already taken place. Again, the parent appointment should be discontinued, and a new schedule request should be made. This procedure removes any ambiguity between applications that may arise with an attempt to modify an appointment that is in progress.
