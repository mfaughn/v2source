This Materials Management chapter defines abstract messages for the purpose of communicating various events related to the transactions derived from supply chain management within a healthcare facility. There are two basic types of messages defined in this chapter: _inventory item master file updates, and supply item sterilization messages_.

The inventory item master file segments published in this chapter are based on master file add and update messages between applications such as _materials management, scheduling, and sterilization applications._

The sterilization and decontamination messages published in this chapter are based on a request, response, or unsolicited update. These transactions occur between an instrument-tracking system and a sterilizer or washer.

This chapter describes various roles under which applications might operate. The roles discussed in this chapter illustrate the underlying model used to develop this specification. They do not imply the need for a particular application model or method of implementation.

This chapter defines the transactions at the seventh level, that is, the abstract message. Various schemes are used to generate the actual characters that comprise the messages according to the communication environment. The HL7 Encoding Rules will be used where there is not a complete Presentation Layer. This is described in Chapter 1, "Relationship to Other Protocols." The examples included in this chapter were constructed using the HL7 Encoding Rules.
