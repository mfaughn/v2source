Each triggering event is listed below, along with the applicable form of the message exchange. The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality, and repetition of segments is described in Chapter 2, "Format for Defining Abstract Messages." There are two classes of events, those which contain notifications only, and those which contain both notifications and content (text contained in OBX segments).

*Note*: Note that the event is encapsulated in MSH-9 and the event segment is deprecated for all MDM message cases as of version 2.5.

When -MSH-9 is valued, the value of EVN-1 must be the same.

These triggering events are mainly associated with documents or entries that will be or have been transcribed. The types and appearance of the transcribed documents can vary greatly within a healthcare organization and between organizations. However, the main purpose of the transcription process is to document patient care or diagnostic results in a legible manner; these documents then become part of the legal medical record. The conceptual purpose of document notification is to facilitate updating the receiving system(s) with information from the source system(s), typically dictation or transcription systems, to indicate that an electronic document has been created or altered. The document notification message can be attached to an entire document (i.e., transcribed document) or can be transmitted stand-alone. In either case, the document notification is transmitted in the form of an unsolicited update or in response to a record-oriented query. A document notification message can be created under a variety of circumstances such as when: 1) dictation has been completed; 2) a document has been transcribed; or, 3) the status of a document has been changed, i.e., when a document has been authenticated.

Also, the orders represented by the ORC/OBR segments must be wholly and exclusively satisfied by the TXA/OBX content. "Wholly satisfied" means there are no other orders related to the TXA/OBX content other than those specified by the ORC/OBR segments. "Exclusively satisfied" means that the actions described by the ORC/OBR segments do not contain actions not addressed by the TXA/OBX content. Thus, the TXA/OBX context must satisfy all instances of ORC/OBR as indicated by _ORC-7 Quantity/Timing,_ _OBR-27 Quantity/Timing_ or the TQ1/ TQ2 segments.

• The placer order number may exist in the ORC, OBR and TXA. If valued in the ORC or OBR and the TXA is present, it should not be valued. If TXA is valued it should be ignored.

• The filler order number may exist in the ORC, OBR and TXA. If valued in the ORC or OBR and the TXA is present, it should not be valued. If TXA is valued it should be ignored.

• Generally the _OBR-32 Principal interpreter_ and the _TXA –22.1 Authentication person_ are conceptually the same. Normally only the _TXA-22.1_ should be valued. If both are valued, the _TXA-22.1_ takes precedence.

The _OBR-35 Transcriptionist_ and the _TXA –11 Transcriptionist_ are conceptually the same. Normally only the _TXA-11_ should be valued. If both are valued, the _TXA-11_ takes precedence.
