The function of this message is to initiate the transmission of information about a general clinical order that uses the OBR segment. OMG messages can originate also with a placer, filler, or an interested third party.

The trigger event for this message is any change to a general clinical order. Such changes include submission of new orders, cancellations, updates, patient and non-patient-specific orders, etc.

This trigger includes segments identified as being for 'previous results.' These segments allow the sending system to include demographic and/or result information from previous result reports when they are related to the current order.

For example:

• Diagnostic laboratories referring tests to another lab for either confirmation of results (HIV, etc.) or due to not being equipped to do the tests (genetic testing, etc.).

• Diagnostic laboratories sending test results to Knowledge Bases for the automated generation of diagnostic comments for inclusion into the lab report.

The CTD segment in this trigger is used to transmit temporary patient contact details specific to this order.

When one wants to convey with the detailed order message a supporting document, such as a CDA, one can transmit that document using the OBX associated with the ORC/OBR(s) using OBX-11 = "O" Order Detail Description Only, using either OBX-2 = "ED" or "RP".

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

[message-tabs, ["OMG^O19^OMG_O19", "OMG Interaction"]]

The function of this message is to respond to an OMG message. An ORG message is the application acknowledgment to an OMG message. See Chapter 2 for a description of the acknowledgment paradigm.

In ORG the PID and ORC segments are optional, particularly in case of an error response. However, ORC segments are always required in ORG when the OBR is present. For example, a response ORG might include only the MSH and MSA.

The function (e.g., cancel, new order) of both OMG and ORG messages is determined by the value in ORC-1-order control. (See the table of order control values for a complete list.)

This message is used to create simple order status updates, through an acknowledgement, for any type of order where the ORC is sufficient to communicate the order identifier and no other data updates are necessary. This is particularly relevant when a status update occurred in response to a new or updated order. The OSU structure allows it to be used instead of, but equivalent to the application level acknowledgement message, e.g., ORG.
