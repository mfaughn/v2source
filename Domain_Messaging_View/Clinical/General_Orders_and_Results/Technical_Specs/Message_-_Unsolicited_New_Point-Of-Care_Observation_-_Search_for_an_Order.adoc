= Message - Unsolicited New Point-Of-Care Observation - Search for an Order 
:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 7.3.5

This event trigger instructs the receiving system to search for an existing order for the observation(s) contained in the message.

In this case, the sending system does not know if an order has been placed. This transaction instructs the receiving system to search for an existing order for the associated results. If the receiver finds an existing order, it should return the Placer ID to the sender in the ORC segment of an OML^O21 message. This information allows the Observation Reviewer to correlate every result with its associated order.

The institution's business rules will determine what the receiving system does if it can't find a matching order. Possibilities include automatically placing an order (as in trigger event R30), or returning an application level error description in the Application Acknowledgement MSA Text Message field..

If it is necessary to pass specific information related to the Patient, responsible Doctor, placing doctor, patient location etc, there is a requirement for the inclusion of a PV1 and PD1 segment in the ORU message type (see also ORU^R30 for description).

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).
