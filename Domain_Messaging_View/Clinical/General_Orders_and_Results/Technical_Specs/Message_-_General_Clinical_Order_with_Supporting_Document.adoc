The purpose of this message is to enable communication of orders using a CDA document type to convey the content of the order (e.g., prescription, lab tests, etc.) while the message infrastructure enables appropriate state management.

It should be noted that, unless orders are communicated at the granular, fully decomposed test/medication/procedure/etc. level, state management can only happen at the group level, i.e., equal to all elements in the document. It also should be noted that identification of individual elements can only be achieved if the CDA document contains appropriate identification while the order numbers in ORC effectively act as a group number.

Once the order manager determines to initiate a new order using this message, then all subsequent state management messages must continue at the document level, forgoing detailed level state management.

When one wants to convey with the detailed order message a supporting document, such as a CDA, one can transmit that document using the OBX associated with the ORC/OBR(s) using OBX-11 = "O" Order Detail Description Only, using either OBX-2 = "ED" or "RP".

The function of this message is to respond to an OMQ message. An ORX message is the application acknowledgment to an OMQ message. See Chapter 2 for a description of the acknowledgment paradigm.

In ORX the PID and ORC segments are optional, particularly in case of an error response. However, ORC segments are always required in ORD when the OBR is present. For example, a response ORD might include only the MSH and MSA.

The function (e.g., cancel, new order) of both OMQ and ORX messages is determined by the value in ORC-1-order control. (See the table of order control values for a complete list.)

This message is used to create simple order status updates, through an acknowledgement, for any type of order where the ORC is sufficient to communicate the order identifier and no other data updates are necessary. This is particularly relevant when a status update occurred in response to a new or updated order. The OSU structure allows it to be used instead of, but equivalent to the application level acknowledgement message, e.g., ORG.

There is not supposed to be an Application Level acknowledgement to an Application Level Acknowledgement message. In Enhanced Mode, MSH-16 SHALL always be set to NE (Never).
