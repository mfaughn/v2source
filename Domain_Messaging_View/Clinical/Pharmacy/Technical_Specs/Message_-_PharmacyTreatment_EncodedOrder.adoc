:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 4A.3.6

This message communicates the pharmacy or treatment application's encoding of the pharmacy/treatment order ,OMP, message. It may be sent as an unsolicited message to report on either a single order or multiple pharmacy/treatment orders for a patient.

The RDE/RRE message pair can also be used to communicate a refill authorization request; however, a specific trigger event has been assigned. See section _4A.3.16 "RDE - Pharmacy/Treatment Refill Authorization Request Message_ (Event O25)_."_ As a site-specific variant, the original order segments (RXO, RXRs, associated RXCs, and any NTEs) may be sent optionally (for comparison).

The event O11 represents an encoding of an order. To communicate explicit dispense requests, which are different event types, the RDE^O11/RRE^O12 message pair is also used, but the event O49 is preferred. See section 4A.3.23 "RDE - Pharmacy/Treatment Refill Authorization Request Message (Event O25)." As a site-specific variant, the original order segments (RXO, RXRs, associated RXCs, and any NTEs) may be sent optionally (for comparison).
