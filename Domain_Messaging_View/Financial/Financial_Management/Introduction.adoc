The Finance chapter describes patient accounting transactions. Other financial transactions may be added in the future. Financial transactions can be sent between applications either in batches or online. As defined in Chapter 2 on batch segments, multiple transactions may be grouped and sent through all file transfer media or programs when using the HL7 Encoding Rules.

This chapter defines the transactions that take place at the seventh level, that is, the abstract messages. The examples included in this chapter were constructed using the HL7 Encoding Rules.
