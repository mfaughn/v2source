= Message - P02 Purge Patient Accounts
:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 6.4.2

Generally, the elimination of all billing/accounts receivable records will be an internal function controlled, for example, by the patient accounting or financial system. However, on occasion, there will be a need to correct an account, or a series of accounts, that may require that a notice of account deletion be sent from another sub-system and processed, for example, by the patient accounting or financial system. Although a series of accounts may be purged within this one event, we recommend that only one PID segment be sent per event.
