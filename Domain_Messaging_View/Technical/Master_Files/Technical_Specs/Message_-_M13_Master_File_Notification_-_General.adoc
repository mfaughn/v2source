== MFN/MFK - Master File Notification - General (Event M13) 

The MFN General master file notification transaction is used where the master file is a simple one that contains only a key and the text value of that key. Both values are carried in _MFE-4 - Primary Key Value - MFE_. The specific master file being updated is identified by _MFI-1 - Master File Identifier_ and _MFI-2 - Master Files Application Identifier_.

The General master file notification is defined as follows:
