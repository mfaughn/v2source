:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 8.4;8.4.3

The MFN Site defined master file notification transaction is used where the master file is not a simple one (as defined for MFN^M13) and is not a transaction type currently defined by HL7, but rather requires one or more HL7 and/or 'Z' segments to carry the master file information.

The Site defined master file notification is defined as follows:
