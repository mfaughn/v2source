It is recommended that site-specific master files use event M13 or M14; alternately a code of the form Znn can be used (see also section 8.5.1, "MFI - Master File Identification Segment.")

The MFN message specifies whether the master file, as a whole, has been replaced or if a record within the file has been updated. See section link:#_MFI-3___File-Level Event Code   (ID[_8.5.13_&#44; "_MFI-3 File Event Code_]," for further details.

The MFN message transmits the specific action taken on a record. See section link:#_MFE-1___Record-Level Event Code   ([_8.5.2.1_&#44; "_MFE-1 Record Event Code_]," for further details.
