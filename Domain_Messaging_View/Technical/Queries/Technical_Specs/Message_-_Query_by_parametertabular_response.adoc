:render_as: Message Page
:v291_section: 5.4.2

The QBP_Q13 structure supports a Tabular Response and contains the MSH, RDF, RCP, and DSC segments. Its default trigger event is Q13. A standard or site-defined query may use this trigger event or may specify a unique trigger event value in its Query Profile. If a unique trigger event value is chosen for a site-defined query, that value SHALL begin with *Z*.

Unless otherwise specified in the query's Query Profile, the default value for the RDF segment shall be understood to contain all available fields from the Virtual Table. The Client may override the default RDF by specifying explicitly the columns to be returned.

The message structure for QBP^Q13^QPB_Q13 can be found in 5.3.1.2. Use the QBP^Q13^QPB_Q13 Message structure.

The RTB_K13 supports a Tabular Response to the QBP and contains the MSH, MSA, ERR, QAK, QPD, RDF, RDT and the DSC. Its default trigger event is K13. A standard or site-defined response may use this trigger event or may specify a unique trigger event value in its Query Profile. If a unique trigger event value is chosen for a site-defined response, that value SHALL begin with *Z*.

The RTB_K13 structure requires that, if any RDT segments are returned, they be preceded by an RDF segment containing the row definition specification for the RDT segments. If no RDF was sent in the query, the default RDF is returned in the RTB_K13.

*Note:* The indicated trigger events are the default values for MSH-9-2-Trigger event. Standard and site-defined queries may use these trigger events or may specify unique trigger event values in their Query Profiles. Unique trigger event values for site-defined queries SHALL begin with *Z*.
